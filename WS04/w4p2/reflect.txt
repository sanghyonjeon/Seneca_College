In this workshop, I learned about the basics of class constructors,
destructors, and references in C++. A constructor is a special member
function of a class. A constructor is automatically called when an object
of that class is created. It is used to initialize the objects of that
class. A default constructor takes no parameters and is automatically
called if no other constructor is specified. Custom constructors can be
created with different numbers of arguments to initialize the object in
a specific way.

When an object of a class goes out of scope, a destructor is
automatically called to free up any memory that was dynamically
allocated within the class. The destructor is the counterpart of the
constructor and is used to prevent memory leaks in C++ programs.

I also learned about references in C++. A reference is the alias for a
variable and can be used to manipulate the original variable. The &
operator is used to declare a reference, and it is initialized with the
address of an existing variable. The reference must be initialized when
it is declared and cannot be changed to refer to a different variable
after that.

One of the difficulties I faced during this workshop was understanding
the use of references in the read() function. I struggled with the
concept of a reference to the current object and how to use it to
return the current object from a member function. However, after
reading the material and practicing with examples, I was able to
understand the concept better.

In conclusion, this workshop was a great opportunity for me to learn
about the basics of class constructors, destructors, and references in
C++. It was a challenging workshop, but I was able to overcome the
difficulties and complete it successfully. I am now more confident
in my understanding of these topics and look forward to using what I
learned in future projects.
