***********************************************************************/
In completing this workshop, I have learned about several important
topics in C++. One of the most important topics was the overload of
binary member operators. I learned how to overload binary operators so
that they can be used with objects of user-defined classes. This is a
very important concept in C++ programming because it allows us to create
more organized and readable code.

Another topic that was covered in this workshop was the creation and
definition of type conversion operators. Type conversion operators are
used to convert objects of one type to objects of another type. This is
an important concept because it allows us to write our code with more 
flexibility.

I also learned about creating and defining helper operators without
using the friendship of a C++ class. This is a useful technique because
it allows us to create helper operators that are not tightly coupled to
a specific class, which makes the code more reusable and maintainable.

Finally, I learned about reusing member operators. I learned how to
reuse member operators by overloading them with different types of
objects, which makes the code more concise and readable. This is an
important concept because it allows us to write more efficient and
readable code.

There were a few concepts that I struggled with, such as the
implementation of type conversion operators and the reusages of member
operators. Although these topics were challenging for me, with the help
of the LAB part of the Workshop, I was more familiar with implementing
the DIY part.

Overall, this workshop was a great learning experience for me. I learned
several important topics in C++ programming and was able to apply my
knowledge to create more efficient and readable code. I am confident
that the concepts and techniques that I learned in this workshop will be
very useful to me in my future programming projects.
