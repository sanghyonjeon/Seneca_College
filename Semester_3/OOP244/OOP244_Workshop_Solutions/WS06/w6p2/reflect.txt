In this workshop and Milestone 1, I learned about defining and creating
copy constructors and copy assignment operators (as well as prohibiting
these actions), also known as the Rule of Three. This is a crucial
aspect of C++ programming as it ensures that the deep copy of an object
is created correctly and that the assignment operator is properly
overloaded. To implement this, I had to understand the difference
between shallow copy and deep copy and the significance of using
pointers and dynamic memory allocation in creating a deep copy.

Additionally, I learned how to read and write to and from text files
using the C++ standard library functions such as ifstream and ofstream.
This involved creating an instance of ifstream/ofstream, opening a file
to read the data from, storing it in an object, and writing data from an
object to a file.

I also learned about resizing dynamically allocated memory. This
involved using new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate
memory dynamically. This is necessary when we need to change the size of
a collection of objects, for example, when adding or removing elements.

Finally, I learned how to overload the insertion operator, which allowed
me to print the contents of an object using a stream, such as cout. I
also learned how to overload the extraction operator, which allows us to
read the contents of an object using a stream, such as cin.

Overall, completing this workshop has helped me gain a deeper
understanding of these concepts and how to apply them in practice. One of
the difficulties that I faced was in understanding the difference between
creating a copy of an object and creating a reference to an object, and
ensuring that the copy constructor and copy assignment operator were
implemented correctly.
